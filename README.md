# Week-2-Project: Sum of Elements in an Array
The code in the project is used to sum the numbers inside any array.
We first created a function that takes in an array as an argument and returns the sum of its elements.
The second part of the code provides a sample array used to test if the function in the code does its intended purpose.
We later call the 'find_sum' function inside the 'print' function to outpu the result of the computation.
